# The-Rise-of-Covid-and-Decline-of-Mental-Health
To what extent has the rise of Covid case rates caused an increase of mental illness in the United States?
The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has caused an innumerable amount of people to have lost their loved ones, jobs, education, opportunities and interactions. In addition, these sudden and drastic losses have come within a relatively short time-span with COVID-19 having caused global shutdowns for only about 2 years. With this information in mind, it wouldnâ€™t be difficult to fathom the negative impact the virus has had on the mental health of the majority of the global population in the United States. The purpose of this study is to answer whether or not there is a relationship between the recent pandemic and increase in mental illnesses using self-reported/diagnosed anxiety and depression as our benchmarks.
